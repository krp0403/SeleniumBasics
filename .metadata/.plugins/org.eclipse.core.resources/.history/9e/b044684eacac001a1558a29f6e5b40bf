/* Interfaces are abstract in nature
 * Interfaces do not have function definition.
 * they only have function declarations.
 * we cannot change values of the variables declared in an interface.
 * variables are by default static in an interface.
 * Most importantly we cannot create objects of an interface. 
 * class implementing the interface has to implement (define) all the methods in Interface. And have its own additional methods as well.
 * example:--->  public class ImplementsExample implements InterfaceExamples { has to implenment all the methods from "interfaceexamples".
 * Once class can implement more than 1 interfaces. With the same rule that it has to implement all functions of the respective interfaces.
